# PostmanAPITestingFramework
This framework tests open-source API's

In this testing framework - I have tested API's and automated the validations required for tests
This framework uses - 
1) Javascript for programming
2) NewMan for CLI integration
3) Data-Driven testing when required
4) Different env can be integrated depending upon use case (As of now testd with QA env)
5) Pre-request script is setup for one of API request
6) Tests are used for validation of API response received
7) Query_params are set in variables
8) Examples are added for each API request to make it easier for review and setup
9) HTML reports are generated


In this repo - I have added json of collection so that you can directly import in your postman tool and can review and make changes as required
Also how to setup new-man and html reporting all commands are also attached in (.txt file)
