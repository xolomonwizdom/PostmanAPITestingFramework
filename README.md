# PostmanAPITestingFramework
This framework tests open-source APIs

In this testing framework - I have tested APIs and automated the validations required for tests
This framework uses - 
1) Javascript for programming
2) NewMan for CLI integration
3) Data-Driven testing when required
4) Different env can be integrated depending upon the use case (As of now tested with QA env)
5) Pre-request script is setup for one of the API request
6) Tests are used for validation of the API response received
7) Query_params are set in variables
8) Examples are added for each API request to make it easier for review and setup
9) HTML reports are generated


In this repo - I have added json of collection so that you can directly import in your Postman tool and can review and make changes as required
Also how to setup new-man and html reporting all commands are also attached in (.txt file)
